## ABOUT US  
  
  
**NEXT WORD PREDICTOR** app helps the user type quickly by predicting the most frequently used word ensuing a word/phrase input by user.  
  
It has been developed as a part of **Data Science Specialization Capstone Project at Coursera**.  
  
This is my first take on Text Analytics and I have tried to explore and execute as permitted by time and resources. The app may not predict a word for every sentence but I have tried to train the model using diverse data sources like news, twitter and blogs to provide a next word prediction. It covers 65% of total dataset provided by Swift Key.  
  
I hope you like my app. I appreciate your patience and time spent during the process.   
  
*Thank you, User!*
