## HOW TO USE  
  
  
**NEXT WORD PREDICTOR** app helps you type quickly and comfortably by providing word suggestions for the word/phrase entered.
  
To provide you with the most suitable word, you are required to enter a word or a phrase in the text box provided in app and Click **Predict Next Word** button.    
  
The phrase entered will then be used to find the most frequently used combination of words resembling the input using the dataset provided by Swift Key. The model then displays the recommended word in the output text box. 

**Note:** Please note that the app may take some time to display the first prediction as data needs to be loaded on server before executing the search algorithm.  
  
Source code for the app - ui.R and server.R files are available on the [GitHub](https://github.com/madhuri333/Next_Word_Predictor).
